# 4.1 j-Query Accordion

This project consisted of making a jQuery Accordion. In this project we worked with NPM scripts and Sass to create the accordion.



### Tech Used

During the development of this project I used the following technology:


* [HTML5] - latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages
* [CSS3] - latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - fast and concise Javascript Library
